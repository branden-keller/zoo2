# GitHub Workflow

In this workshop, you will practice using `git` to version control your projects.
You will also learn some best practices on how to collaborate with other
developers on code using GitHub.

Since this workshop focuses on working with another developer, **do not continue
to the next section until your partner is ready**! The steps _must_ be followed
in the given order.

## Getting Started

Designate one student to be Student A, and the other to be Student B.
If there is a third person, they will be Student C.
